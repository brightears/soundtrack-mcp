Review all changes, create a descriptive commit, push, and create a PR:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review changes
2. Stage relevant files (never stage .env or secrets)
3. Write a clear commit message describing the "why"
4. Push to the current branch
5. Create a PR with summary and test plan
